For Your Eyes Only, 007.

Your mission (aside from stopping Goldfinger) is to execute numerous programs in near synchronization.

Q has constructed a new gadget for you to complete this mission.  It is called "runall"

You must infiltrate main memory by supplying it with 3 programs prior to executing the "runall"

We've constructed a scrollbar on the right hand navigation for your convenience during the testing phases.

If your time window for execution is not to your liking, just remember you have your "quantum" to change it.

Miss Moneypenny will guide your job list.  Just take a look at "agedum.js"

Godspeed, 007.  M out.
